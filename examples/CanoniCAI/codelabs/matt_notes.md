I have added notes in the various files in this folder (denoted by two hrs and italics) in the places where I got stuck. 

In general, the documentation is good. It covers a lot of ground and introduces many new concepts (for me, anyway).

The areas where I had problems were:

## My local dev environment

I am relatively inexperienced with Python so trying to get the right versions of Python and pip in place was tricky.

## Loading of modules and models

This was a problem at various points during my journey, particularly during production phase.

## Sentinels

I didn't have a mental model of sentinels and so really struggled when trying to deploy.

## The Front End

There were no instructions how to run it and quite a bit of extraneous JS code knocking about so I ended up building a Vue app instead.
